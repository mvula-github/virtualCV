#Introduction
This project showcases a modern electronic portfolio or CV crafted using React which is a JavaScript library and Vite. This project is targeted to potential employers who will see my programming skills and may or may not hire me. As stated, before the purpose of this documentation is to provide a brief overview of the project.

##Web technologies
The web technologies used to build this virtual CV  are React, which utilizes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Vite. Google Chrome was used as a web technology for testing the functionality and design of the website. Other technologies used were Git and GitHub which had the sole purpose of source control, versioning, and deploying.

##Navigation and UI Design
1.	Navigation Bar
 
This is the navigation bar, it has the logo and following scroll links home, about, skills, work, and contacts. Once you click one of the links it will scroll to the named section, i.e. If the user clicks work, the page will auto-scroll to the work section.

2.	Mobile Navigation Bar
This is the navigation sidebar for when the screen resolution is of a tablet or a mobile smartphone, and it works similarly to the above navigation sidebar.
 

3.	Home
This is the home section, and you can download the CV, and view my picture if you hover or click(on mobile) it becomes clear with colour. It also serves as a heading section of the virtual CV.
 

4.	Technical Proficiency
The technical proficiency section covers the skills I have acquired throughout my degree from backend skills, frontend skills, soft skills, and technical tools used. Each of my skills is displayed through an animated progress bar and animated as you change skills.
 
5.	Work Experience
This section covers my work experience for the companies or organizations I have worked for. They are displayed on a carousel effect and can move around them by clicking the arrows for a mobile device you can slide.
 

6.	Contact Me
This section covers how a visitor, user or potential employer can contact me through social media, email, and tech social platforms. If the employers want to email me quicker, they can send a message on the form.
 
#Compatibility
The website is compatible with any device that has a web browser either a laptop, tablet, or mobile smartphone device.  It can work on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

#Innovation
Innovative features of this project are the animated progress bar, as it is generic and not hard coded meaning, thus new data can be added, and it would still work fine. The carousel animation of the work experience section is innovative as well as it uses a popular React library called React Slick. The website is also responsive on all devices, easy to navigate for types of users and not static to be interactive.

#Hosting
Hosting this Vite + React web application was not usually deployed in the normal way of how a web application would be hosted on GitHub pages. External information was used to host or deploy the web application.
